Consider...
(1) "[3/6] Running liftover.py" & "[4/6] Running jcvi_diploid.py with -p 3 --cpus 33 --cscore 0.99" are slow, so it freezes on these for a bit. 
    - We can dynamically print how many have been complete to show that its working and not frozen and give user a sense of time remaining. 
(2) The JCVI syntenic dotplot may be useful for troubleshooting. The JCVI script flexibily outputs those. We can modify the wrapper to create a dotplot dir to store those. 
(3) We should ship with a default protein file, but for now, Im not concerned. 
(4) N+1.
(5) Polyploids will need parameters adjusted. I've tried to be flexible about adding parameters for this, but not tested yet.
